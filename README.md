# Flutter Base Example
This project is to showcase the various techniques I use for programmatically development. 
Often programming methods are presented as compositional vs inheritance, this demo will showcase both and demonstrate these two methods are not at odds, but rather complementary.

- Inheritance design patterns
- Compositional design patterns
- Model based riverpod design
- Programmatically based go router

These patterns may seem overly complex at face value, but when considering a company with multiple applications, the early planing to control deviation and reduce technical debt should become apparent.

Where this example is constructed as a single application, it should be easy to see how these examples can be applied to more complex models when utilizing something like a mono-repo.
